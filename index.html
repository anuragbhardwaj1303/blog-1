    <h1 id="title">Why You don't need a therapist</h1>
    <cite>By Anurag Bhardwaj</cite>
    
    <section id="info">
      <h3 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer ! : If you are someone who's suffering from clinical depression then a therapist can help you in curing it better</h3>
      <h5>Now if you are someone who's stressed out of some stuff happening around you or with you or something which affects your mental health, then you just don't need to see any therapist.</h5>
      <h5>what you need most is just a friend with whom you can share everything(literaly everything), good or bad, every win or loss that too without any hesitation.</h5>
      <h5>Now you shared your issue with your friend, now what , they can just give you advice, they can just show you the path to peace, Now you have to figure it out on your own.</h5>
      <h5>Firstly, find what's disturbing your mental peace?Is it really worth to think about that thing,like if it's something about your career or your professional life, then it is worthy to think about that.</h5>
      <h5>But if it is something about some person, then evaluate the issue on following basis<cite>(well that's how I do it)</cite>:</h5>
      <h5>Does their presence really affect your career or your professional life, if yes, then go call them,clear all your misunderstandings, clear everything what's bothering you. Have the audacity to speak up for yourself.</h5>    
     <h5>Does their presence really affect your Personal life, if yes, then just talk to them, stop making random or bullshit assumptions, and clear everything with them. Also stop expecting too much from everyone, lesser expectations lesser Disappointment</h5>
     <h5><cite>A healthy relationship is that in which both the Partners have mutual understanding.</cite></h5>
     <h5><code>If situation is getting toxic, just move out of it, It is not enough worthy to affect your mental peace</code></h5>
     <h5><cite>If you are facing something similar, don't try to avoid it, it'll just kill you from inside. Just act smart, find the root of issue(most of the time it is Overthinking) and resolve it.</cite></h5>
     <h4>Here's a quick tip from me, What I follow :</h4>
     <ul>
     <li><h5>Having a fixed sleep schedule will help you plan and execute your day well</h5></li>
     <li><h5>Start your day as early as you can, I'm not asking you to wake up at 4 or 5 AM but atleast wake up by 8 AM and get ready to start studying or doing your work by 9 AM</h5></li>
     <li><h5>Keep track of all your habits/tasks, like what you have to do and what you did, It'll help you to manage all your tasks, you'll start feeling productive, It'll also motivate you to achieve you more Next Day</h5></li>
     <li><h5>Have a habit of reading or writing daily, Read or write anything but do it on daily basis, Start brushing up your Brains</h5></li>
    </ul>
